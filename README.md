Nutrifriend is a system that can act as a personal nutritionist. The FatSecret API enables the user to fetch information in a number of ways. The following are the 3 main modules of the system:

-Food Description: It lets the user know about various nutrients present in a food item. These results are obtained through the API after a food item is searched. The API matches the keyword and shows multiple outputs.

-Recipes: This column helps in adding recipes, viewing added recipes or searching recipes directly using the API. 

-Diet Plan: It allows the user to either make his own diet plan or obtain a plan that is automatically generated by the system as a recommended diet plan based on the userâ€™s BDI.
